## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/guylepage3/lepage.cc/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.  Please use [Slack](http://papriika.slack.com) as it is a better places to get help.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

### When reporting a bug, include:

* Operating system and version (Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Win10 Mobile)

* Browser and version (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, MS Edge, Opera 15+, Android Browser)

* Reduced test cases and potential fixes using [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com)

### Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. **Validate and lint your code** &mdash; [validate your HTML](https://html5.validator.nu) and [lint your HTML](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint) to ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; [Search for duplicate or closed issues]().

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master`, `design` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example. [This JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/lolome/edit?html,output) is a helpful template.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
